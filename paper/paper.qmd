# Introduction 
# Data
Data for this analysis was sourced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the United States [@citeData]. Statistical modelling and data cleaning was done using Python. Python was also used to create the visualizations, and the dashboard that accompanies this analysis [@citePython]. 

```{python}
# clean data 

```

```{python}
data['UNIT'].value_counts()
```

## Plastic Pollution Discrepancies By Ocean  
```{python}
ocean_data = data[data['OCEANS'].notna()]
ocean_data['OCEANS'].unique()
ocean_data = ocean_data[ocean_data['UNIT'] == "pieces/m3"]
ocean_data = ocean_data.groupby(['OCEANS'])['MEASUREMEN'].mean().reset_index() 
ocean_data
```
